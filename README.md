## Overview

Looking for a laugh? This app is a web scraper targeting the joke news site Clickhole, giving users the option to save articles to a database, and then add notes to them. Simply click the "Scrape" button to show up all new clickhole articles. From the home page, you can see a title and brief summary of each article. You can also follow a link to the article itself. If you like one of them, you can save them to the database, add your thoughts, and then view all saved articles under the "saved" page.

## Challenges

The first project to incorporate MongoDB as a backend, along with several express routes, this project proved one of the most time consuming, but also one of the most rewarding. Working on it helped build understanding of how the MongoDB database worked, how to organize several different routes, and how to incorporate scraped web data into an app.

## Final-Thoughts

I completed this project, which would have worked very well paired with React, while on the edge of learning React. As a result, I began learning how to make MERN apps with an appreciation for how it streamlined some of the processes that were intensive to build in this app.
